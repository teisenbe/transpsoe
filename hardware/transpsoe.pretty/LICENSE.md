The footprint file is authored by Tess Eisenberger, and is licensed under CC0. It was created using dimensions from https://www.taydaelectronics.com/datasheets/files/A-2566.pdf. A 3D model may be found at https://www.3dcontentcentral.com/download-model.aspx?catalogid=171&id=774448, but it is not available for distribution.
